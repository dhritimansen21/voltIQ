# VoltIQ ⚡

**Real-Time Electricity Usage Forecasting & Theft Detection System**

VoltIQ is a hardware-integrated system that combines low-cost IoT sensing with machine learning to forecast electricity consumption and detect theft or anomalies in real time. It pairs an ESP32-based sensing unit with an ML-powered dashboard, and can automatically cut off load when theft is confirmed.

---

## 📌 Overview

Traditional electricity meters lack real-time anomaly detection and give no predictive insight into usage. VoltIQ addresses this by combining low-cost ESP32-based hardware sensing with ML models for consumption forecasting and theft/anomaly classification — enabling real-time detection of irregularities through an interactive dashboard, with an automated relay-based cutoff for confirmed theft events.

**SDG Alignment:** SDG 7 — Affordable and Clean Energy

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Design and build a low-cost ESP32-based hardware unit for real-time voltage and current sensing.
2. Develop ML models for accurate short-term electricity usage forecasting.
3. Detect anomalies and electricity theft using anomaly detection and classification models.
4. Implement an automated load-cutoff mechanism for confirmed theft events.
5. Build an interactive dashboard visualizing usage trends, forecasts, and alerts in real time.
